          <p>You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but this may affect the Blog's functionality.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Core Web Vitals:</strong> We collect anonymous performance data about our Blog (LCP, CLS, FID) for
          analysis and improving user experience. This aggregated data is stored on the server and contains no personal
          information.

      <h2>3. Legal Basis for Data Processing</h2>
      <p>We process your personal data on the following legal grounds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> You consent to the processing of your personal data when registering on the Blog
          and providing additional information in your profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Contract:</strong> Processing is necessary to fulfill the contract between you and us (providing
          access to the Blog's features).</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> We process your data for our legitimate interests, such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring Blog security and preventing abuse.</li>
            <li>Analyzing Blog performance using Core Web Vitals.</li>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Data Retention Period</h2>
      <p>
        We retain your personal data as long as your account remains active. User comments are stored until either
        deleted by the user or until the user account is deleted. Likes are removed along with the user account or when
        the like is revoked by the user. Core Web Vitals data is stored in aggregated form and is not associated with
        specific users.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>Data Replication</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure fault tolerance, we use <strong>synchronous PostgreSQL replication</strong>. This means your data is
        duplicated on additional servers in real-time.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> When you delete your account, your data is <strong>immediately removed from both the
          primary database and all replicas</strong>. We do not maintain data backups, therefore recovery of deleted
        information is impossible.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>

        a court order). Please note that our cloud hosting provider may collect technical data as part of their
        services, but we do not control this activity. We recommend reviewing Selectel's <a
